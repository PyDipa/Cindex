# Cindex
 A recursive calculation to identify the best Composite index

This script provides a forward-stepwise algorithm used to identify the best combination of features that maximizes the Fisher's distance between  two classes of data. Selected features  are synthetizied into a composite index (Cindex). 
In the example, the feratures are a a set of climate-related variables and the resulting composite index represent the combination of specific, selected features, that maximize the distance between exceptional high and low olive yields over Italy in the period 2006-2020.

Rationale and further details are presented in:
